# CodeChallenge CMovie
Solve the riddle and provide one of two possible movies

Once all code is complete, make the following modifications in sequence to the linked list data while running the program:

   * edit where selected node is 55 to v=69
   * insert where selected node is 45, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 42, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 37, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 34, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 31, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 23, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 22, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 16, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 13, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 12, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 8, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 5, make  v=32
   * insert where selected node is 1, make v=114
   * delete node 66
   * insert where selected node is 31, make v=46
   * insert where selected node is 18, make v=58
   * edit where selected node is 1 to v=46
   
Be sure the resulting code properly prints all values from the linked list as provided. Once you confirm your code properly compiles and runs make the above changes to the data. Enter selection item 5 from the menu, which is hidden. Copy the resulting output message (series of numbers) and solve the riddle.
